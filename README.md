# pics

A system for displaying pictures from a File Server.

## Usage

Put the file next to your other files in your File Server and make them accessible via a browser, like such:

<img src="./docs/example-screenshot.png" width="50%"/>

Resulting in a `domain.tld/my-pictures/pics.htm` looking something like:

<img src="./docs/pics-screenshot.png" width="50%"/>
