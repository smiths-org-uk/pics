# pics

A system for displaying pictures from a File Server.

## Usage

Put the file next to your other files in your File Server and make them accessible via a browser, like such:

<img src="./docs/example-screenshot.png" width="50%"/>

Resulting in a pics.htm looking something like:

<img src="./docs/pics-screenshot.png" width="50%"/>

Then open your browser and navigate to the pics.htm file.
